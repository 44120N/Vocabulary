                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>The history of human civilization is <b>entwined</b> with the history of ways we have learned to manipulate water resources. 
                    As towns gradually expanded, water was brought from increasingly remote sources, leading to <b>sophisticated</b> engineering efforts such as dams and aqueducts. 
                    At the height of the Roman Empire, nine major systems, with an innovative layout of pipes and well-built sewers, supplied the occupants of Rome with as much water per person as is provided in many parts of the industrial world today.

                <div class="title">Paragraph B: How a global challenge was met</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p> During the industrial revolution and population explosion of the 19th and 20th centuries, the demand for water rose dramatically. 
                    <b>Unprecedented</b> construction of tens of thousands of monumental engineering projects designed to control floods, protect clean water supplies, and provide water for irrigation and hydropower brought great benefits to hundreds of millions of people. 
                    Food production has kept pace with soaring populations mainly because of the expansion of artificial irrigation systems that make possible the growth of 40 % of the world’s food. 
                    Nearly one fifth of all the electricity generated worldwide is produced by turbines spun by the power of falling water.

                <div class="title">Paragraph C: The relevance to health</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>Yet there is a dark side to this picture: despite our progress, half of the world's population still suffers, with water services inferior to those available to the ancient Greeks and Romans. 
                    As the United Nations report on access to water <b>reiterated</b> in November 2001, more than one billion people lack access to clean drinking water: some two and half billion do not have <b>adequate</b> sanitation services. 
                    Preventable water-related diseases kill an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 children every day, and the latest evidence suggests that we are falling behind in efforts to solve their problems.

                <div class="title">Paragraph D: Environmental effects</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>The consequences of our water policies extend beyond <b>jeopardizing</b> human health. 
                    Tens of millions of people have been forced to move from their homes - often with little warning or compensation - to make way for the reservoirs behind dams. 
                    More than 20% of all freshwater fish species are now threatened or endangered because dams and water withdrawals have destroyed the free-flowing river ecosystems where they thrive. 
                    Certain irrigation practices degrade soil quality and reduce agricultural productivity. 
                    Groundwater aquifers* are being pumped down faster than they are naturally <b>replenished</b> in part of India, China, the USA and elsewhere. 
                    And disputes over shared water resources have led to violence and continue to raise local, national and even international tensions.

                <div class="title">Paragraph E: Scientists’ call for a revision of policy</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>At the outset of the new millennium, however, the way resource planners think about water is beginning to change. 
                    The focus is slowly shifting back to the <b>provision</b> of basic human and environmental needs as top priority - ensuring ‘some for all,’ instead of ‘more for some’. 
                    Some water experts are now demanding that existing infrastructure be used in smarter ways rather than building new facilities, which is increasingly considered the option of last, not first, resort. 
                    This shift in philosophy has not been universally accepted, and it comes with strong opposition from some established water organisations. 
                    Nevertheless, it may be the only way to address successfully the pressing problems of providing everyone with clean water to drink, <b>adequate</b> water to grow food and a life free from preventable water-related illness.

                <div class="title">Paragraph F: A surprising downward trend in demand for water</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>Fortunately - and unexpectedly - the demand for water is not rising as rapidly as some predicted. 
                    As a result, the pressure to build new water infrastructures has <b>diminished</b> over the past two decades. 
                    Although population, industrial output and economic productivity have continued to soar in developed nations, the rate at which people withdraw water from aquifers, rivers and lakes has slowed. 
                    And in a few parts of the world, demand has actually fallen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content reveal">
                <div class="title">Paragraph G: An explanation for reduced water use</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>What explains this remarkable turn of events? Two factors: people have figured out how to use water more efficiently, and communities are rethinking their priorities for water use. 
                    Throughout the first three-quarters of the 20th century, the quantity of freshwater consumed per person doubled on average; in the USA, water withdrawals increased tenfold while the population <b>quadrupled</b>. 
                    But since 1980, the amount of water consumed per person has actually decreased, thanks to a range of new technologies that help to conserve water in homes and industry. 
                    In 1965, for instance, Japan used approximately 13 million gallons* of water to produce $1 million of commercial output; by 1989 this had dropped to 3.5 million gallons (even accounting for inflation) - almost a <b>quadrupling</b> of water productivity. 
                    In the USA, water withdrawals have fallen by more than 20 % from their peak in 1980.
                </p>

            <div class="content reveal">
                <div class="title">Paragraph G: An explanation for reduced water use</div>
                <div class="lineh"></div>
                <p>On the other hand, dams, aqueducts and other kinds of infrastructure will still have to be built, particularly in developing countries where basic human needs have not been met. 
                    But such projects must be built to higher specifications and with more accountability to local people and their environment than in the past. 
                    And even in regions where new projects seem <b>warranted</b>, we must find ways to meet demands with fewer resources, respecting ecological criteria and to a smaller budget.
